The pc should have an node.js, mySQL Workbench and an IDE installed on it to run this application (VS Code is recommended).
Put all the files and folders in one single folder and open that folder in VS Code. Also make ".env" file in this folder with specific details

.env :-
      PORT=3000
      HOST=localhost
      USER=root
      PASSWORD='your-password goes here'
      DATABASE='assistants'
